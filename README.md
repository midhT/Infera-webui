Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run "Infera Web UI" on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Node.js (includes npm - Node Package Manager): Download and install Node.js from nodejs.org. This project uses npm for dependency management and running the development server.

Installation
Clone the repository (or download the files) to your local machine.

If you have a GitHub repository for this project, replace <YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL_HERE> below with your actual repository URL.

git clone <YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL_HERE>
cd my-chatbot-app

Navigate into the project directory:

cd my-chatbot-app

Install the dependencies:
This command will download all the necessary React, Tailwind CSS, and other libraries defined in package.json.

npm install

Running the Application
Start the development server:

npm start

This command will compile the React application and start a local development server.

Open in Browser:
Once the server starts, it will typically open your default web browser to http://localhost:3000. If it doesn't open automatically, or if port 3000 is in use, check your terminal for the exact URL where the application is running (it might be http://localhost:3001 or another port).

You should now see the "Infera Web UI" chatbot in your browser!

Customization
Your Name and Role
You can easily change the predefined user name and role by editing the `src/App.js` file:

```javascript

// Inside src/App.js

const userName = "YourNameHere"; // Change "Midhat" to your name

const userRole = "YourRoleHere";   // Change "boss" to your preferred role (e.g., "developer", "user")
