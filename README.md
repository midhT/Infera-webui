## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run "Infera Web UI" on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js** (includes npm - Node Package Manager): Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). This project uses `npm` for dependency management and running the development server.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (or download the files) to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd my-chatbot-app
    ```
    (Replace `<your-repo-url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository)

2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd my-chatbot-app
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**
    This command will download all the necessary React, Tailwind CSS, and other libraries defined in `package.json`.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This command will compile the React application and start a local development server.

2.  **Open in Browser:**
    Once the server starts, it will typically open your default web browser to `http://localhost:3000`. If it doesn't open automatically, or if port `3000` is in use, check your terminal for the exact URL where the application is running (it might be `http://localhost:3001` or another port).

You should now see the "Infera Web UI" chatbot in your browser!

## Customization

### Your Name and Role

You can easily change the predefined user name and role by editing the `src/App.js` file:

```javascript
// Inside src/App.js
const userName = "YourNameHere"; // Change "Midhat" to your name
const userRole = "YourRoleHere";   // Change "boss" to your preferred role (e.g., "developer", "user")
